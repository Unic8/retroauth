I split the project into 2 separate ones.

 * [retroauth](retroauth)
  This is the base implementation, to be used in plain java/kotlin projects.
 * [android-accountmanager](android-accountmanager/)
  On top of the pure Kotlin implementation there's the Android implementation, which uses the
Android AccountManager in order to store Owners (Accounts) and their Credentials.
