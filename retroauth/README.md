# A simple way of calling authenticated requests using retrofit
[![Build Status](https://www.bitrise.io/app/d4189e3709bdf16d.svg?token=KpeuDTgCOEWgfL4RoZaVLQ&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/d4189e3709bdf16d)
## Dependencies
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) 2.3.0

## Example:
This is how you would create an authenticated call using retroauth. Just create
the interface as you're used to and annotate your authenticated methods as such.
using the ```@Authenticated``` annotation.
``` kotlin
interface SomeService {
    @Authenticated
    @GET("/some/path")
    Call<ResultObject> someAuthenticatedRequest();
}

```

``` kotlin
interface SomeService {
    @Authenticated(ownerType = 1, tokenType = 1)
    @GET("/some/path")
    Call<ResultObject> someAuthenticatedRequest();
}

```

If you're an Android Developer feel free to go directly to the [android implementation](retroauth-android/).
## How to use it?

Add it as dependency:
```groovy
implementation 'com.andretietz.retroauth:retroauth:x.y.z'
```

## The API

This library is made for a system that CAN have multiple users.
These users CAN have multiple different ```TOKEN```s of a specific ```TOKEN_TYPE```.
A User is an ```OWNER``` of a ```TOKEN```, so within the library they're called ```OWNER```.
You can also have different ```OWNER_TYPE```s.

 * ```OWNER_TYPE``` -> contains one or more:
   * ```OWNER```s -> owns one or more:
     * ```TOKEN_TYPE```s -> is bound to exactly one ```TOKEN```

In most of the cases you probably need only one ```OWNER_TYPE``` which contains one ```OWNER```, which owns one ```TOKEN``` of a specific ```TOKEN_TYPE```.
Which is totally fine.


The API provides 3 interaces and an abstract class. All of the
### The interfaces
  * [OwnerManager](src/main/java/com/andretietz/retroauth/OwnerManager.kt): In order to handle one or more Owners on a system you need to provide some basic functionalities to handle this Owners.
  * [TokenStorage](src/main/java/com/andretietz/retroauth/TokenStorage.kt): So that
  * [MethodCache](src/main/java/com/andretietz/retroauth/MethodCache.kt):
  This is an interface optionally to implement. If you don't, you can use it's default implementation, the ```DefaultMethodCache```.
  * [TokenProvider](src/main/java/com/andretietz/retroauth/TokenProvider.kt): This is an abstract class and it's supposed to be the interface to the backend you're authenticating against.
