# A simple way of calling authenticated requests using retrofit
[![Build Status](https://www.bitrise.io/app/d4189e3709bdf16d.svg?token=KpeuDTgCOEWgfL4RoZaVLQ&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/d4189e3709bdf16d)
## Dependencies
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) 2.3.0

## Example:
Your services using retrofit:
``` java
public interface SomeService {
    @GET("/some/path")
    Call<ResultObject> someRequest();
}
```
Your services using retroauth:
``` java
public interface SomeService {
    int ACCOUNT_TYPE = 1;
    int TOKEN_TYPE = 2;
    @Authenticated({ACCOUNT_TYPE, TOKEN_TYPE})
    @GET("/some/path")
    Call<ResultObject> someRequest();
}

```
If you're an Android Developer feel free to go directly to the [android project](retroauth-android/).
## How to use it (Java)?

Add it as dependency:
```groovy
compile 'com.andretietz.retroauth:retroauth-core:2.3.1'
```

An Authentication with this library requires 3 generic classes, which you should aware of, before implementing. You can use whatever you want, for explanation reasons I'll use their generic names

 * A class: TOKEN_TYPE - you will generate this class out of the information, the Annotation on the method provides you
 * A class: TOKEN - This is a Token which you'll need to authenticate your requests with
 * A class: OWNER - The owner that owns the Token after the login. 

A common scenario: every OWNER owns mulitple TOKENs of multiple TOKEN_TYPEs
 
### 1. Implement an OwnerManager

``` java
public interface OwnerManager<OWNER, TOKEN_TYPE> {
    OWNER getOwner(TOKEN_TYPE type) throws ChooseOwnerCanceledException;
}
```
 * If the owner does not exist, return null. 
 * If there are multiple owners ask the user to choose one.
   * throw an ChooseOwnerCanceledException when the user canceled choosing.


### 2. Implement a TokenStorage
``` java
public interface TokenStorage<OWNER, TOKEN_TYPE, TOKEN> {
    TOKEN_TYPE createType(int[] annotationValues);
    TOKEN getToken(OWNER owner, TOKEN_TYPE type) throws AuthenticationCanceledException;
    void storeToken(OWNER owner, TOKEN_TYPE type, TOKEN token);
    void removeToken(OWNER owner, TOKEN_TYPE type, TOKEN token);
}
```
 * "createType" - create your custom token type out of the values you're using in the annotation
 * "getToken" - get the token
   * When owner doesn't exist, create one
   * When token doesn't exist, request one
 * "storeToken" - store a token of a token type
 * "removeToken" - remove the token of a token type


### 3. Implement a MethodCache (optional)

``` java
public interface MethodCache<TOKEN_TYPE> {
    void register(int requestIdentifier, TOKEN_TYPE type);
    TOKEN_TYPE getTokenType(int requestIdentifier);
}
```
This should be a simple key value store. If you don't want implement this by yourself, use the default implementation.


### 4. Implement a Provider
``` java
public interface Provider<OWNER, TOKEN_TYPE, TOKEN> {
    Request authenticateRequest(Request request, TOKEN token);
    boolean retryRequired(int count, Response response,
                          TokenStorage<OWNER, TOKEN_TYPE, TOKEN> tokenStorage, OWNER owner, TOKEN_TYPE type, TOKEN token);
}
```

* "authenticateRequest" - implement the provider specific modification of the request to authenticate your request ([okhttp3.Request](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/Request.java))
* "retryRequired" - take a look onto the response and decide by yourself if you want the request to be retried or not
  * This method is a perfect place for refreshing tokens if required.
    * Example: You get a 401 response, you can use the TokenStorage object to remove the current Token (cause it's invalid), call a token refresh endpoint and store the new token also using the TokenStorage.
    return true to retry the whole request and it shouldn't return a 401 anymore. For details see the [android example](retroauth-core/).

Wrap all of the together into the AuthenticationHandler and create your retrofit object

``` java
    AuthenticationHandler<OWNER, TOKEN_TYPE, TOKEN> authHandler = new AuthenticationHandler<>(
            new MethodCache.DefaultMethodCache<>(),
            new MyOwnerManager(), myTokenStorage, myCustomProvider
    );

    Retrofit retrofit = new Retroauth.Builder<>(authHandler)
            .baseUrl(<some-base-url>)
            .build();

```


Take a look at the Java8 Demo implementation, which uses java-scribe to authenticate against the google-apis
